Title: Correct citation inequality measures for marginals bias via resampling
Description: Kim, Adolph, West, and Stovel (2020) show that measures of inequality are subject to ``marginals bias,'' which impairs the ability to compare measures across time or contexts.  Consider the example of citation distributions, which describe the relative shares of incoming citations sent to each member of a population of published papers, e.g., for a specific field and year.  Inequality measures like the Gini coefficient (and even typically robust measures such as quantiles of the distribution) are only comparable across disciplinary fields or time periods if both the total number of papers potentially receiving citations and the total number of citations sent to this population remain constant.  If these ``marginals'' are rising, inequality may be understated, and if they are falling, inequality may be overstated.
